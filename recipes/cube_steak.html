    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great recipe made by Bibi</p>
    <h3>Indgredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces cube steak, cut into 4 portions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce, divided </li>
        <li>½ cup water </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly season both sides of each cube steak with salt and pepper. (See Cook's Note).</li>
        <li>Melt 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once butter is foamy, add cube steaks and sprinkle about 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce on top of each cube steak. Cook until brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the steaks, and sprinkle each with an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Cook until steaks are firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove to a platter and tent with foil.</li>
        <li>To make the pan sauce, pour about 1/2 cup water into the skillet and stir all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil and cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in remaining butter, until melted.</li>
        <li>Evenly divide pan sauce over each cube steak and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
